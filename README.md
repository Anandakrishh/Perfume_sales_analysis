# Perfume_Sales_Analysis

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Sales overview 

Through 𝐏𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐈 data-driven analysis, I identified the best-selling fragrances, the impact of customer reviews on sales, and the role of discount strategies in influencing purchasing decisions. Understanding how Aquatic, Fruity, and Citrus fragrances dominated the market, while Stick-based packaging slightly outperformed Spray and Roll-On formats.

## Objectives

- Which fragrance type sells the most? Should we increase production for a specific type?
- How does customer feedback impact sales?
- Which sales channel is most profitable? Should we focus more on e-commerce or physical stores?
- What pricing strategy works best?

## Solutions (Objectives)

1. **Fragrance Demand:**  
   - Aquatic, Fruity, Citrus, and Spicy fragrances have the highest demand (**6.4M units each**).  
   - Increasing production in these categories while optimizing lower-selling fragrances can improve inventory management.  

2. **Impact of Customer Reviews:**  
   - Reviews significantly influence sales.  
   - Perfumes with **excellent (20.2M units sold)** and **good (18.7M units sold)** ratings outperform average-rated products.  

3. **Sales Channel Performance:**  
   - **Myntra, Amazon, and Flipkart** contribute to the highest sales (**~$4.2B+ each**).  
   - Strong e-commerce performance suggests focusing on **digital marketing and exclusive online promotions** to boost revenue.  

4. **Discount Strategy:**  
   - Discounts between **10-30%** drive **maximum sales**.  
   - Higher discount levels don’t always guarantee increased revenue.
